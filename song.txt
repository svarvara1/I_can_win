Is anybody home
I'm feeling so alone

I've been waiting all my life
To meet someone like you
It's a bittersweet sensation
Yes you think that we are through
You should have paid a visit to
The love I had inside
Now I'm left with my obsession
Where will you lay your heart tonight

I'm feeling so alone
My heart is like a stone
I feel like I am the only one with a broken heart
Hello
Is anybody home
I've been hanging by the phone
I wonder if I'm the only one with a broken heart


Guess I can't get over you
I can't forget that day
It's a bittersweet sensation
Yes you think you walked away
What am I supposed to do
I want to make things right
But I'm lost in my obsession
Where will you lay your heart tonight


I'm feeling so alone
My heart is like a stone
I feel like I am the only one with a broken heart
Hello
Is anybody home
I've been hanging by the phone
I wonder if I'm the only one with a broken heart
And now...

I can't turn back time
I'm sorry
For the things I said
I'm sorry too
Is there something I can do
Now the silence and the darkness
is painting me in blue


I'm feeling so alone
My heart is like a stone
I feel like I am the only one with a broken heart
Hello
Is anybody home
I've been hanging by the phone
I wonder if I'm the only one with a broken heart
